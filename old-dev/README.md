# WS281X-splitter
Verilog code for a WS281X string splitter and breakout box.

This code has 2 purposes:

1. split one long string of WS281X nodes into multiple shorter strings

2. show the last WS281X node (24 bits) as a breakout (for debug)

I am initially developing this for a Xilinx XC9572XL CPLD (72 macrocells) on a Guzunty board.
I am using Xilinx WebPack 14.7 (no cost license), and a XC9572 CPLD because it is 5V tolerant and readily available (~ $12 for a board on eBay).  However, other tools and CPLDs/FPGAs might work.

I chose Verilog over VHDL because I prefer the more C-like syntax and the pre-processor macros in particular.  This is my first CPLD/FPGA project and I am just learning Verilog and VHDL, so the code probably isn't that great.

Current status:
- main module sim and synth okay
- the tester module is able to run sims of all components (controlled by #defines near the top)
- TODO: actually run it on some hardware
